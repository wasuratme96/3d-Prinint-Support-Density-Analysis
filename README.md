# 3D Prinint Support Density Analysis

## Background
When transform CAD design into actual part, 3D printing is one of the fastest options. <br>
But when it come to the strong, light-weight and high chemical resistance, titanium is well-known in this area. <br>


It is also best in biocompatibility, which make it an ideal materials for medical applications such as implant device. <br>
By the way, titatnium is difficult metal to work with machining method due to its low thermal condictivity. <br>
Which mean all the heat generated during machining process will be stored in the machining tool. <br>
Wear rate would be accerelated.
